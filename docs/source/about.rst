About the package
=================

"PECCARY" stands for Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics.
The acronym was chosen in honor of the collared peccary (*Tayassu tajacu*), which is a
resident of the Sonoran desert (along with the author of the package). Collared peccaries
often go by the colloquial name of "javelina" and can be found throughout the desert southwest
of the United States, as well as Mexico, and areas of Central and South America.

The PECCARY logo features this amazing animal running on a galaxy disc. The "Y" of PECCARY takes
in the shape of the famous saguaro cactus, which is endemic to the Sonoran desert.

What is a peccary?
------------------
Peccaries are a mammals that resemble wild boars and hogs, but are in fact not pigs. There are
at least three species of peccary: the collared peccary (or javelina), the white-lipped peccary,
and the Chacoa peccary. Unlike pigs, which are native to Eurasia and North Africa, peccaries are
native to the Americas, and are primarily found in Central and South America, as well as the 
southwest United States and areas of the Caribbean. There are many physical differences between
peccaries and pigs, including scent glands and well-developed canines. For more information on the
collared peccary, or javelina, check out the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum's 
`fact sheet <https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/Javelina.php>`__.
